# Pokemon_Proj

Currently working on the project to better visualize, comprehend, and analyze pokemon data. I chose to work with a Pokemon dataset because my younger cousin is new to pokemon so I thought I would provide him unique and interesting visualizations and a better understanding of the pokemon typings and skillsets within the game. Also, I created a basic machine learning model to better predict legendary.
